U  can try and read my lyrics of of this paper b I lay'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before i say'em

'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it

I don't give a damn what you think, i'm doing this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
